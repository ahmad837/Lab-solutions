# Lab Sheet 2

## Question 1

Write a program to calculate the electricity bill. The rates of electricity per unit are
as follow:

If the units consumed are equal or less than 300,then the cost is Rs. 3/- per unit If units consumed are more than 300,then the cost is Rs. 3.5/- per unit and surcharge of 5% of bill is added

## Question 2

Write a program that reads 5 marks of different subjects out of 100 from the
keyboard and determines and displays the sum and percentile of the marks. Then print grades
and credit points on the basic of percentile as per following table:

| Grade | Credit Points | Percentage Marks |
|:-----:|---------------|------------------|
| A | 4.0 | 90 and above |
| A- | 3.7 | 85-89 |
| B+ | 3.3 | 80-84 |
| B | 3.0 | 75-79 |
| B- | 2.7 | 70-74 |
| C+ | 2.3 | 65-69 |
| C  | 2.0 | 60-64 |
| C- | 1.7 | 55-59 |
| D  | 1.3 | 50-54 |
| F  | 0.0 | Less than 50 |

## Question 3
While purchasing certain items, a discount of 10% is offered if the quantity
purchased is more than 1000. If quantity and price per item are input through the keyboard, write

## Question 4

A company insures its drivers in the following cases:

* If the driver is married.
* If the driver is unmarried, male &amp; above 30 years of age.
* If the driver is unmarried, female &amp; above 25 years of age.
* In all other cases the driver is not insured.

If the marital status, gender and age of the
driver are the inputs, write a programme to determine whether the driver is to be insured
or not
Hint: For marital status you may ask user to enter 0 for married and 1 for unmarried. You may
ask user to enter 0 for male and 1 for female.

## Question 5 

* Print numbers from 1 to 100 with increment of 1
* Print numbers from 100 to 1 with decrement of 1
* Print numbers from 20 to 2 in steps of -2
* Print sequence of numbers: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20
* Print sequence of numbers: 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, 11, 0

## Question 6

Write a program that reads in five integers and then determines and prints the largest
and smallest integers in the group. Use only the techniques you have learnt so far, and make sure
that the program only uses three variables. (Hint: use two of the variables to hold the current
largest and smallest integers.)

## Question 7

Write a program that reads a number and determines and prints whether it is odd or
even. (Hint: use the modulus operator. Any even number is multiple of two, and any multiple of
two gives a remainder of zero when divided by two.)

## Question 8

Write a program which asks the user to enter 10 numbers and prints out the message
“even” if the number is even and “divisible by three” if the number is divisible by three.

## Question 9

A person invests $1000.0 in a savings account yielding 5% interest. Assuming that
all interest is left on deposit in the account, calculate and print the amount of money in he
account at the end of each year for 10 years. Use the following formula for determining these
amounts:

a = p(1 + r)^n

where

* p is the original investment(i.e. the principal)
* r is the annual interest rate
* n is the number of years
* a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year.

### Sample output
| Year | Amount on deposit |
|------|-------------------|
| 1 | 1050.00 |
| 2 | 1102.50 |
| 3 | 1157.63 |
| 4 | 1215.51 |
| 5 | 1276.28 |
| 6 | 1340.10 |
| 7 | 1407.10 |
| 8 | 1477.46 |
| 9 | 1551.33 |
| 10 | 1628.89 |
