* Design a class Cylinder, which has following members:
   * Data:
      * radius
      * height
  * Constructor
    * A no-argument constructor
    * A one-argument constructor receiving height and setting radius to default value 1
    * A two-argument constructor receiving height and radius
  * Methods:
    * Setter functions (total 2)
    * Getter functions (total 2)
    * computeArea
    * computeVolume
    * look for the relevant formulae over internet
  * displayInfo
    * Showing cylinder height, radius, area and volume
    * Test class to test Cylinder
    * Demonstrate all the above constructors/methods by creating different objects and calling each constructor/method at least once
